  "According to the analysis of the data, there is some correlation between average module marks and average module attendance. However, there is only a weak correlation between commute length and average module attendance. This shows the importance of the students attending as many timetabled slots as possible, regardless of how far they live or how long it takes for them to travel to their campus. This project shows a basic analysis of the data; however, there are many factors affecting performance and attendance at university. The project aims to emphasise on data visualisation and the power of charts to simplify complex data.";
